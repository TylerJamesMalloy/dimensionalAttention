Installation
============


.. _installation:

The latest version of PyIBL can be downloaded and installed from PyPi with ``pip``:

  .. parsed-literal:: pip install pyibl

Use of a virtual environment for Python, such as `venv <https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/venv.html>`_
or `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_ is recommended.

PyIBL requires Python version 3.8 or later.

Note that PyIBL is simply a Python module, a library, that is run as part of a larger
Python program. To build and run models using PyIBL you do need to do
some Python programming. If you're new to Python, a good place to
start learning it is `The Python Tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/>`_.
To write and run a Python program you need to create and edit Python
source files, and then run them. If you are comfortable using the command
line, you can simply create and edit the files in your favorite text editor,
and run them from the command line. Many folks, though, are happier using
a graphical Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
`Many Python IDEs are available <https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments>`_.
One  is
`IDLE <https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/idle.html>`_,
which comes packaged with Python itself, so if you installed Python
you should have it available.

This document is also available at `http://pyibl.ddmlab.com/ <http://pyibl.ddmlab.com/>`_.

Users and others interested in PyIBL are encouraged to subscribe to the
`PyIBL Users mailing list <https://lists.andrew.cmu.edu/mailman/listinfo/pyibl-users>`_.
Announcements of new versions of PyIBL are made here.

Please report bugs to `Don Morrison <mailto:dfm2@cmu.edu>`_.
